## Question Number 1 ðŸš€
1) Danish has opened a seed bags selling shop. He wants to arrange the bags in the order in which a bag expires first. These bags have a twelve-digit code where:

        â€¢	the first four characters are Batch Number.
        â€¢	The next 8 digits represent the seed expiry date in YYYYMMDD format.

    Generate a Java code to extract the batch number and expiry date from package code and validate it.

    ### Validations:
        â€¢ Batch number is valid only if the  first, second and fourth characters are alphabets in uppercase and the third character is a number.
        â€¢ Year is valid only if it is between 2015 and 2020, both inclusive.
        â€¢ Month is valid only if it is in between 1 and 12 (both inclusive).
        â€¢ Day is valid only if it is between 1 and 31 (both inclusive).
    ### Methods to be Implemented
        boolean lengthCheck(String_code):
        â€¢ Compute the length of String code and return true if length is 12 else return false.

        boolean batchNumberCheck(String_code):
        â€¢ extract the batchNumber and validate it

        boolean yearCheck(String_code):
        â€¢ extract the year and validate it

        boolean monthCheck(String_code):
        â€¢ extract the month and validate it

        boolean dayCheck(String_code):
        â€¢ extract the day and validate it

## Question Number 2 ðŸš€
2) John has recently learned about HashSet  in Java. He wants to implement the basic operations like subtract, union, intersect using HashSet. Help John in implementing the basic functionalities.
    ### Specification:
        class definitions:
        class HashSetImplementation:
        method definitions: 
            unionOfElements (Set<Integer> s1, Set<Integer> s2):
 			    return type: Set<Integer>
                visibility: public

            subtractionOfElements (Set<Integer> s1, Set<Integer> s2):
                return type: Set<Integer> 
                visibility: public

            intersectionOfElements (Set<Integer> s1, Set<Integer> s2):
                return type: Set<Integer> 
                visibility: public


    ### Methods to be Implemented:
        Class HashSetImplementation

        Implement the below methods for this class:
            Set<Integer> unionOfElements  (Set<Integer> $1, Set<Integer> s2); 
        return the union of two sets
        (Hint: add all elements of set s2 in set s1 and return set $1.)

        Set<Integer>subtractionOfElements(Set<Integer> $1, Set<Integer> s2): 
        return the difference of two sets. Subtract all the elements of $1 which are in s2 and return the set $1.
        (Hint: select the element from first Set if it is there in second set then delete it from first set.)

        Set<Integer>intersectionOfElements(Set<Integer>$1, Set<Integer>s2);
        return the intersection of two sets

## Question Number 3 ðŸš€
3) Your task here is to implement Java code based on the following specifications. Note that your code should match the specifications in a precise manner.
    ### Specification:
        class definitions:
            class Company:
 	            data members:
                    name: String
                    requiredCandidates: int
                    Company (String name, int requiredCandidates): constructor with public visibility

            class JobPortal:
            method definition:
                applyJob (Company jobData, String companyName, int numberOfCandidates) throws Exception 
                    visibility: public
                    return type: String
            class CompanyNotFoundException:
            method definitions:
                CompanyNotFoundException(String str)
                    visibility: public
            class NoVacancy FoundException: 
            method definitions:
                NoVacancyFoundException(String str)
			        visibility: Public


    ### Methods to be Implemented:
        Class Company.
        - define the String variable name. 
        - define the int variable required Candidates.
        - define a parameterized constructor as specified above.

        Class JobPortal
        Implement the below methods for this class:
        String applyJob(Company jobData, String
        companyName, int numberOfCandidates):
        
        Write a code to apply job for the given number of candidates.
        
        - If the company Name is not the same in the jobData then throw a CompanyNotFoundException with a message "no such company found".
        
        - If the given company is having a required candidate less than the numberOfCandidates then throw a NoVacancyFoundException with a message "no vacancy available".

        -If no Exception is found then decrease the number of candidates required of that company with the number of candidates applied, also return the message "applied successfully".

        Class CompanyNotFoundException
        -define custom exception class CompanyNotFoundException by extending the Exception class.

        -define a parameterized constructor with a String argument to pass the message to the superclass.

        Class NoVacancyFoundException
        -define custom exception class NoVacancyFoundException by extending the Exception class.

        -define a parameterized constructor with a String argument to pass the message to the superclass.
